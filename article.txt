McDonalds claims they make "real beef" burgers. They claim the burgers are so cheap because they "buy in bulk." There are 6 ingredients, too many flavors for Jesse, but its only 250 calories, so that's something. Make sure to remember that McDonalds burgers are 100% REAL BEEF---Did you know that 40% of people in America like their burgers well-done? Only 2% like their burgers rare! Isn't that crazy town!---There are so many cattle farmers in this world, but they don't get paid what they deserve! The beef prices are rising, but farmers don't get any benefits! We need to appreciate the people who make our food, because one day, they might stop making it!
