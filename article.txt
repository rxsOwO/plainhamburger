McDonalds claims they make "real beef" burgers. They claim the burgers are so cheap because they "buy in bulk." There are 6 ingredients, too many flavors for Jesse, but its only 250 calories, so that's something. Make sure to remember that McDonalds burgers are 100% REAL BEEF---Did you know that 40% of people in America like their burgers well-done? Only 2% like their burgers rare! Isn't that crazy town!
